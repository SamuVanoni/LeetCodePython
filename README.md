# LeetCodePython

## How to practice?

- Understand the data structure (Binary Tree)
- Understand the algorithms of this structure (DFS)
- Repeat the exercises in LeetCode (About the chosen algorithm)
- Identify patterns

Repeat this for each topic

## How to start? (Plan)

1. We can start with the "Top100 Liked Questions"

2. Then focus on the questions by topic => String, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion, Binary Tree, Backtracking, DFS, BFS, Graph, Linkedi List, Sort, Trie, Slack/Queue, Piority Queue, Dynamic Programming

**Important** => Array, String, Sorting, Counting

3. Sort by acceptance rate rather than difficulty

4. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: maximum 45 minutes per exercise! If you can't do it in that time, look at the solution.
After learning the solution, look for a similar exercise and put the learning into practice.

5. Revisit the problems

6. Further ahead: Solve company-specific questions
