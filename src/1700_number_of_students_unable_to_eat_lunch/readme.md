## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I learned:

1. I created a variable with the total sandwiches. If you have someone who can take the sandwich: the person takes, is removed and decrees the variable. This happens until you find a sandwich that no one can take and stop by break. The answer will be the variable we were decreed.
