## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I put into practice more about counter and range() loop:

1. count
```python
count = 0
...
count += 1
```
Variable used to count each time an occasion occurs

2. range()
```python
for i in range(len(jewels)):
```
Here we make a loop that only takes the index of each letter within the string jewels
