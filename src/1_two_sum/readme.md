## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge, I learned two different ways to traverse a list in Python:

1. Using
```python
for i, value in enumerate(nums):
```
This allows us to get both the index and the value of the list.

2. Using
```python
range(i + 1, len(nums))
```
In the other type of loop, we only get the index of the list.
