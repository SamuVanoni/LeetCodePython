## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I learned new ways to solve a challenge:

1. We created three different arrays, one with values ​​smaller than pivot, another equal and another with larger values.
```python
[n for n in nums if n < pivot]
[n for n in nums if n == pivot]
[n for n in nums if n > pivot]
```
