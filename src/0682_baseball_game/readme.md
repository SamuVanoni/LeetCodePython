## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I learned:

1. Remembering how to get the last element of a Python list easily
```python
ans[-1]
```

2. Deleting an element without storing it (the pop () would store the value if necessary)
```python
del ans[-1] # Example with pop (): VALUE = ANS.POP()
```
