## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I learned how to transform a sentence into words (array) and the other way around:

1. Turning the sentence into separate words in an array
```python
s = s.split()
```

2. Joins the words in `r` into a string, separated by spaces
```python
return ' '.join(map(str, r))
```
