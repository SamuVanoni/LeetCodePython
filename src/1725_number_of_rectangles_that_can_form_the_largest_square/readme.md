## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I learned:

1. Creating an array with the lowest values ​​of each matrix (it would be Lenght)
```python
len_arr = [min(rectangle) for rectangle in rectangles]
```

2. Returning the count of the highest value among the Lenght
```python
return len_arr.count(max(len_arr))
```
