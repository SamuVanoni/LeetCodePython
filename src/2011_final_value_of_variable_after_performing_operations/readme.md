## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I practiced the for loop and made string equality:

1. For loop
```python
for operation in operations:
```

2. String equality
```python
if operation == "--X" or operation == "X--":
```

3. Python does not accept `x++`, we have to perform `x += 1`
```python
x += 1
```
