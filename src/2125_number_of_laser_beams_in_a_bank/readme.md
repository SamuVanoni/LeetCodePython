## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge I had a different view of how to solve a problem and how to use count():

1. Counting the number of times 1 appears in the string
```python
res = i.count('1')
```

2. I racked my brain thinking about a different way to do it and this way was much simpler and faster (I looked at the solutions)
