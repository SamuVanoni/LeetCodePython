## What Did I Learn?

### In this challenge, I learned two functions and two loops that traverse a string:

1. Function
```python
abs()
```
We use it to get the module of a number


2. Function
```python
ord()
```
We use it to get the value of a letter in the ASCII table


1. Loop with index and value in string
```python
s = "hello"
for i, value in enumerate(s):
```
With this loop we can get both the index and the value of each letter in the word


2. Loop with index in string
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
```
With this loop we can get only the index of each letter in the word
